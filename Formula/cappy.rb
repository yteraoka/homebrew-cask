  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      The first recording asks the terminal app you run cappy from for
      the "System Audio Recording" and "Microphone" permissions.
      Run `cappy init` to create the config file interactively, and
      `cappy doctor` to check permissions, authentication and settings.
      Set CAPPY_LANG=ja to show messages in Japanese.
